Hello! This is a computer science project done by Serge Strizhov under the guidance of Dragutin Petkovic at San Francisco State University.

None of the material is meant to be used commercially. This is purely for learning purposes. 

This was meant to be a way of teaching myself user oriented design with material from Professor Petkovic with his relevant feedback.

The code isn't meant to be fully working nor of quality, but rather, something to be used to help slightly in presentation of what a working website WOULD look like.

Has a lot of hard coded values, but once again, not the one of importance in this project.

Bootstrap or similar software was NOT used in this project to learn more about raw HTML and CSS. Bootstrap will be learned in the future. It was honestly quite difficult managing all the page visuals to even slightly look right.

Thank you for your time!

Serge Strizhov
